a siamese network implementation with pytorch\
\
siamese networks work by having 2 identical (all the weights and everything are the same) convolutional networks to extract 2 input images features. then the 2 features distance (aka dissimilarity) is calculated to see how similiar they are.the loss function used for training siamese networks is generally contrastive loss(another type of loss function can be used).\
